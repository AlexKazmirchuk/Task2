# Completed test Task 2

Create android application with next requirements:
1. Using [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) load a list of https://github.com/JakeWharton public repositories. 
2. Display the list in RecyclerView with the same information like on Github (name, one line description (cut if need), language, number of stars and forks, update date).
3. Click on any item of the list opens new Activity with detailed information about project:
* Title
* Description
* Number of stars
* Number of forks
* Number of watchers
* Number of issues
4. Use Material design guidelines.

Feel free to use any open source 3rd party libs to complete task 2.

Will be a plus: 
* Screen rotation handling
* Support different screen resolutions
* Test coverage
* Caching and offline access
